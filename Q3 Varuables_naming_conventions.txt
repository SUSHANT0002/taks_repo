Variables and Naming Conventions
A.Task: You are given the following code snippet written with poor naming conventions. Refactor the code to make it more readable, maintainable, and follow proper naming conventions.

def fnc1(a, b):
    r = a * b
    x = r + b
    return x

def calc(a, b):
    c = a + b
    res = fnc1(a, b)
    return c, res

Solution:

def calculationFunction(num1,num2):	
    munltiplication = num1 * num2 	# here we will multiply both num1 and num2 and store the result in multiplication variable
    sum = multiplication + num2 	# here we will add multiplication variable and num2 and store the result in sum variable	
    return sum 				# this function will return the sum variable

def calculation(num1,num2):
    sum = num1 + num2				#here we will add num1 and num2 and store the result in sum variable
    result = calculationFunction(num1, num2)	#here we will store the reult of calculationFuntion(num1,num2) in result variable
    return sum, result				#at last we will return sum and result variable




B.Instructions:

i.Rename variables and the function to meaningful names that reflect their purpose.
ii.Add comments (if necessary) to improve code readability.
iii.Ensure your refactored code follows camelCase or snake_case conventions, based on your preferred language or project style.
