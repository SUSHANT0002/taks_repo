1.first we have initialized the git repository in our local machine using 
"git init"

2.Then I created some files in my work space directory using
"mkdir Assignment_1"

3.then I created a remote repo on the github where we need to push the changes

4.then in work space I completed my tasks and added it to the stagging area using 
"git add ." 
here  "." is reffered as all the files

5.then from stagging area  commited those changes to the local space using 
"git commit -m "initial commit"
here a flag is used "-m" that enables us to write the message in the command

6.then we have to connect the local with the remote using
"git remote add origin https://github.com/SUSHANT0002/Assignment_1.git"

7.then I switched to the main branch and pushed my changes to the remote repo
"git branch -M main"
"git push -u origin main"

8.then I created a new branch "feature" using 
"git checkout -b feature"

9. Now I have created a new file index.txt and will push it on the feature branch using
"git push -u origin feature"
